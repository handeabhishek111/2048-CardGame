# 2048 Card Game

## How to run the project: 

### Clone the repo and do the following steps
- Ensure you havea mongo db database conneced 
(db name: ngc, colection name: duel, queue)

```
% npm i
% npm run start:dev
```

###  In this game main focus is creating your 2048 nft game cards by playing the 2048 game and scoring as high as possible. Then you can duel with other players for a staking amount which you would get doubled if your nft game card has higher scores than your opponent.
### This project uses a simple game, which is 2048, adds tiles of the same number to get the tile of 2048. We are trying to implement this on blockchain adding the numbers and increasing your score which in turn increases your chances in a duel.
### When the tiles cannot be moved any further the score is reached for a user and the game is over, then he/she can create an NFT Scorecard using the same score. Those cards can be further used in a duel which will be done on the blockchain.
